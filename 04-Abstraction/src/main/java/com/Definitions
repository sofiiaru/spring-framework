How Spring manages Beans? through scopes

Spring bean scopes:
- Singleton* - default; spring creates a singleton bean when it loads the context and assigns jthe bean a name (Bean ID).
 It is called singleton because you always get the same instance when you refer to a specific bean.
 Singleton concept allows multiple instances of the same type. For Spring, singleton means unique per name,
 but not uniques per app
