Spring Project Structure

src/main/java - contains application source code
src/main/resources - contains non-java resources
src/test/java - contains test code

mvnw and mvnw.cmd - maven wrapper scripts. You can use these scripts to build your
project even if you do not have maven installed on your machine

pom.xml - Maven build specs

Application.java - SpringBoot main class that bootstraps the project.

application.properties - this file initially empty but offers a place where you can specify configuration properties

static - contains any static content:images, css, js, etc.
templates - contains templates files that will be used to render content to the browser (ex. Thymeleaf)

ApplicationTests.java - this is a simple test class that makes sure that Spring app content loads successfully. You
will add more tests once you build your app.
